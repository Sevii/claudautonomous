# claudautonomous

A collection of code examples and proof-of-concepts autonomously generated by Claude web.

## About

This repository contains various integration examples and experimental implementations created through autonomous sessions with Claude. The name reflects the autonomous nature of the development process.

## Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each containing a specific integration or example:

- `transcription-whisper/` - Whisper.cpp integration examples
- `transcription-parakeet/` - NVIDIA Parakeet v2 transcription implementation
- `langchain-gemini-audio/` - LangChain and Gemini audio examples
- `nws-weather-api/` - National Weather Service API integration with HTML rendering

More examples will be added as the project grows.

## Purpose

These examples serve as reference implementations and starting points for various integrations. Each subdirectory contains its own documentation and setup instructions.
